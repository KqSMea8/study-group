NB: Some other stuff was running on my computer at this time
so the benchmarks are slower than for ex2.4 and ex2.5....
but running ex2.4 and ex2.5 now would show the same times as here.

However the relative results remain the same, and the
expected timing of clearing being half that of shifting is shown.

Using a lookup table remained consistently the fastest and not using a 
loop remains a little slower when consulting the loop.
